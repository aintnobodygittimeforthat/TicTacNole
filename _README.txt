Welcome to TicTacNOLE

Note that TicTacNOLE.java is the name of the driver class for this game.

TicTacNOLE should compile/run in NetBeans and the command line
just fine. However I got a few warnings when I moved the files over
to Eclipse. I hope that is fine, seeing as it still compiles/runs
with those warnings.
